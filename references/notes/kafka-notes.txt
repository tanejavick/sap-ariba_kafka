		- Topic			=> stream of records
		- Partition		=> portion of topic divided based on some logic to scale the storage and improve parallelism 
		- Offset 		=> uniquely identifies each record within the partition
		- Leader		=> leader partition handles all read/write requests
		- Follower		=> passively replicate the leader and follow the instructions
		- Producer		=> publish data to the topics
		- Consumer		=> consume the published data from the topic subscribed by the consumer group it belongs to
		- ConsumerGroup	=> logical group of consumers to subscribe and process data published in a topic


		- Broker		=> component which provides messaging and storage capabilities
		- Node			=> single physical server where broker runs
		- Cluster		=> group of brokers
		- Replication	=> duplication of partition for fault tolerance by given replication factor
